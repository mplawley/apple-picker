# installation and play

Open Unity and start Scene 0 for easy difficulty. Start Scene 1 for hard difficulty. Use your mouse to catch the apples!

# motivation

After doing a fair amount of Unity development this year, I wanted to ensure that there are no holes in the foundation of my knowledge. So I am going through Jeremy Gibson's Game Design, Prototyping, and Development textbook and building the 5 prototypes he gives the reader to do. This is the first prototype.
